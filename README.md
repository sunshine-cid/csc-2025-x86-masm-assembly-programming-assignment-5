x86 MASM 10-Week Condensed College Course CSC-2025 this is the fifth programming assignment

----------

Write a program that accomplishes the following

  1. Sequentially prompts the user to enter hours, minutes, and seconds
  
  2. Saves the user inputs in memory and uses the values to compute the total number of seconds.
  
  3. Outputs the original inputs with appropriate labeling text
  
  4. Outputs the total number of minutes and seconds with appropriate labeling text
  
  5. Provides the user with the option to repeat the program. Make sure that the repeat option is not case sensitive. You can use one non-case sensitive answer to repeat and any key to exit.
  
  Here is an example of the program functionality:

    Enter the number of hours: 5
    
    Enter the number of minutes: 4
    
    Enter the number of seconds: 3

    The number of hours entered was 5.
    
    The number of minutes entered was 4.
    
    The number of seconds entered was 3.
    
    The total number of minutes is 304 minutes.
    
    The total number of seconds is 18243 seconds.
    
    Try again (y/n)? y
